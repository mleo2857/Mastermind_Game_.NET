Steps to follow in Creating Mastermind Game:

1. Initialize integer array size 4
2. Populate the array with 4 random numbers from 1-6
3. Ask for the user to input 4 numbers in a while loop, limiting to 10 responses
4. Convert user response to an integer array
4. initialize a string output array
5. Compare each element of user response to the elements of the randomly generated code, adding the appropriate symbols to the output array
6. If the user gave the correct code, end the game
7. Output the string output array and ask for user input again
8. Repeat until user guesses correctly or reaches 10 tries
